# Adding Apple Watch Support to zaCalc2

I've created the necessary files for Apple Watch support. To complete the setup, follow these steps in Xcode:

## Files Created:
- `zaCalc2-watch Watch App/` - Contains the watchOS app files
- `WatchResultsView.swift` - Simplified results view for Apple Watch
- `ContentView.swift` - Main watch app view
- `zaCalc2_Watch_AppApp.swift` - Watch app entry point
- `CalculatorData.swift` - Copy of shared data model
- Info.plist is auto-generated by Xcode (GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES)

## Steps to Add watchOS Target in Xcode:

1. **Open the zaCalc2.xcodeproj in Xcode**

2. **Add watchOS Target:**
   - Select your project in the navigator
   - Click the "+" button to add a new target
   - Choose "watchOS" â†’ "App"
   - Name it "zaCalc2 Watch App"
   - Make sure it's set to use SwiftUI
   - Click "Finish"

3. **Watch App Files:**
   - The watch app files are already in the "zaCalc2-watch Watch App" folder
   - These files are automatically configured for the watch target

4. **Configure Target Membership:**
   - Select `CalculatorData.swift` and make sure it's included in both iOS and watchOS targets
   - Make sure all watch app files are only in the watchOS target

5. **Build and Run:**
   - Select "zaCalc2 Watch App" scheme
   - Choose your Watch simulator
   - Build and run

## Features:
- Two-page interface optimized for Apple Watch
- Page-based navigation (swipe or use Digital Crown)
- Simplified layout with bold variable names on left, values right-aligned
- Automatically adapts to user's measurement unit preferences

**Page 1 - Recipe Results:**
- Total Dough Weight
- Ball Weight
- Total Flour
- Preferment information (for sourdough)
- Baker's Yeast amount (for baker's yeast)
- Water, Salt, Oil, Sugar amounts

**Page 2 - Toppings:**
- Pizza size and selected style
- Scaled topping amounts for current pizza size
- All toppings from the selected pizza style
- Scaling information (from reference size to actual size)

All values automatically use the same units (grams/ounces) as configured in the iOS app.
