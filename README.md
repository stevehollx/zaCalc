This is an app available on the Apple app store that calculates pizza ratios based on time and temp, using known sourdough and baker's yeast growth curves.

Yeast growth models were led by TXCraig1 on pizzamaking.com with many users contributing to the validation and improvment of the models. As a result of Craig sharing this information freely, this app will remain free on the app store forever, and is available open source here as well.
